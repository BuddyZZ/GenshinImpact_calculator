# GenshinImpact_calculator

总的来说，这是一个用来学习c++和linux的一个小玩具
目前实现的主要功能是计算伤害期望并在此基础上找到最合适的圣遗物副词条配比
下一步应该是添加一个windows下的界面，使得大多数人可以拿来就用(想用Qt）

Overall, this is a little toy for learning c++ and linux
Main functions that have been implemented now is to calculate the damage expectation and to find the most suitable subtext ration for the Artifacts based on this.
The next step may be to add a interface, so that most people can use it (want to use Qt)
